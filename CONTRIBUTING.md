# Contributing to this repo

Read first [the deployment instructions](DEPLOYMENT.md), so that you
can have a working copy of the site there before you start.

The site is mostly written in Perl 5, so you will need a good
knowledge of this language. 

Please run the tests and check that everything is in working order
before you push.
